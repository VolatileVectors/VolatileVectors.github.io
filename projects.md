## SLiquid

SLiquid is a simple and lighweight VR-ready fluid simulation suitable for Unity's legacy, LWRP & URP render pipelines. Inspired by [Job/Vaction Simulator's liquids](https://uploadvr.com/job-simulator-coffee) the focus is on performance instead of physical acuracy, making it a viable choice not only for desktop but also mobile hardware like the Oculus Quest.

## SnapXR

SnapXR is a VR-enabled GIF replay recorder for Unity. It automatically records the past few seconds of gameplay to a GIF file on demand. Frames are grabbed using Unity's AsyncGPUReadback.Request API to grab frames without stalling. GIF Encoding is done in a lowpriority backgroundthread in order to not interfer with the main gameplay loop. SnapXR is provided as an easy to configure component that can be attached to any camera (normal and stereoscopic alike) to record GIFs from whatever a camera renders in Unity.
