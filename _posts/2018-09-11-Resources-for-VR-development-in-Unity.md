## VRTK
[VRTK](https://www.vrtk.io) is arguably one of the best assets out there to get you started on developing VR experiences for Unity. It recently released version 4 which is still in beta but already very stable and useable.  
It can be found here: [https://www.vrtk.io](https://www.vrtk.io).

At this point it is still lacking a lot of documentation but the [VRTK Academy - https://academy.vrtk.io](https://academy.vrtk.io) will be expanded with further tutorials and has everything to get you started. [VRTK](https://www.vrtk.io) is distributed with a sample scene (The Farm) that has examples of all of its features and can be used to dive in further.  
Additionally there is a regularly expanded list of raw Brain Dump videos from its creator, covering various topics, which can be found here:

An overview about the components VRTK is build upon can also be found on VRTK's youtube channel:

## Oculus Developers
A host of Oculus related resources can be found on Oculus' [Developer Portal](https://developer.oculus.com). Even though it's focused on Oculus' own ecosystem of head mounted displays, a lot of the information found on the site and the blog that is useful for VR development in general:
